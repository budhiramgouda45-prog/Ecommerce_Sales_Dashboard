   - Among products, **Canon** items sell the most, and **Copiers** generate the highest profit margin, highlighting profitable product lines.

2. **Time-Based Trends:**  
   - Sales in **February** are low ($0.0M), while **November** peaks ($0.3M), showing strong **seasonal demand**.  
   - Monthly trends help businesses plan promotions and inventory for peak periods.

3. **Regional Performance:**  
   - **East and West regions** outperform others, suggesting areas for targeted marketing campaigns.  

4. **Customer Segments:**  
   - The **Consumer segment** contributes the most sales, highlighting key audiences for retention and upselling strategies.
